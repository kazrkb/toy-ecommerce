# 🌐 **Deploy on Netlify**

## ⚠️ **Important Note:**
Netlify is primarily designed for **static sites** and **serverless functions**, not full Express.js applications. For your Node.js/Express app, **Railway** or **Render** would be much better choices.

However, if you still want to try Netlify, here's how:

## 🚀 **Netlify Deployment (Advanced Option):**

### **Step 1: Go to Netlify**
Visit: [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)

### **Step 2: Connect GitHub**
1. Sign up/Login with GitHub
2. Click **"Add new site"** → **"Import an existing project"**
3. Choose **"Deploy with GitHub"**
4. Select: `kazrkb/toy-ecommerce`

### **Step 3: Configure Build Settings**
```
Branch to deploy: main
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: .
Node version: 18
```

### **Step 4: Environment Variables**
Add in Netlify dashboard:
```
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=your-netlify-secret-key
```

### **Step 5: Deploy**
Netlify will attempt to deploy, but may have issues with the Express server.
